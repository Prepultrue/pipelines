    description: >-
      `fibre_density_and_crosssection` enables group analysis of diffusion MRI data
      by performing a Fixel-Based Analysis (FBA) of Fibre Density,
      Fibre Cross-section and a combined measure (Fibre Density & Cross-section).

# -vox_size FLOAT
#    define the voxel size (in mm) to be used during the upsampling step
#    (participant1 analysis level only)

# -group_subset GROUP_SUBSET
#    Define a subset of participants to be used when generating the group-
#    average FOD template and response functions. The subset is to be supplied
#    as a comma separate list. Note the subset should be representable of your
#    entire population and not biased towards one particular group. For example
#    in a patient-control comparison, choose equal numbers of patients and
#    controls. Used in group1 and group2 analysis levels.

# -num_tracks INT
#    define the number of streamlines to be computed when performing
#    tractography on the FOD template. (group3 analysis level only)

# -num_tracks_sift INT
#    define the number of streamlines to remain after performing SIFT on the
#    tractogram(group3 analysis level only)
